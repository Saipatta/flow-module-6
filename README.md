This Cadence program on the Flow blockchain facilitates the generation of NFTs and integrates essential functions like deposit, borrow, withdraw, and more. These functionalities support diverse financial transactions within the blockchain ecosystem.

##Overview:
Tailored for the Flow blockchain, this Cadence program serves as a smart contract. By executing various functions that alter the blockchain state through transactions, it not only enables NFT creation but also implements a spectrum of interactions and adjustments. With a clear-cut structure, it ensures efficient management of NFTs and their associated resources within the blockchain ecosystem.

##Running the Program:
To run this program, utilize the Flow Playground, an online Cadence IDE. The code compilation involves importing the non-fungible token standard into the main contract. Subsequently, a "borrowauthnft" function is created as per project requirements. An interface is established, integrating specific functions to be publicly accessible. Finally, deploy the transaction to retrieve and read the metadata stored within the NFT.
